Visual & Functional Quality Gate (/audit)
**Description:** Performs an elite-level audit of the UI/UX and logic against the 2026 "Visual Excellence" and "Responsible App" standards.
Step 1: Environmental Check
- Open the integrated browser and navigate to the local development URL.
- Verify the build is stable and the Next.js 16 compiler has finished the initial render.
Step 2: Visual Excellence Audit
Analyze the current view against these non-negotiable standards:
1. **Information Architecture (IA):** Is the page organized by user goals? (Scannable in <3 seconds).
2. **Modular Bento Grid:** Is the layout structured in a clean, high-density grid? Check for consistent spacing tokens.
3. **Glassmorphism:** Are backdrop-blur and transparency effects applied consistently to cards and sidebars?
4. **Typography:** Is Kinetic Typography active? Ensure fonts are legible and reactive to interaction.
5. **sidebar Audit:** Is the sidebar visually quiet? Grouped by intent, not features?
Step 3: Interaction & Trust Audit
Perform a "Stress Test" on the UX:
1. **Immediate Feedback:** Do all buttons and links acknowledge input instantly (<100ms)? 2. **System States:** Verify existence of:
-**Loading:** (Skeletons used during data fetch).
- **Empty State:** (Clear CTA when no data exists).
- **Error State:** (Recoverable, non-blaming messages).
- **Success State:** (Toast notifications for completed actions).
3. **Optimistic Ul:** Do mutations update the UI immediately before the server responds?
4. **Intent Check:** Are Modals used for high-commitment/destructive tasks and Popovers for quick edits?
Step 4: The Audit Report
Output a report in the chat with the following structure:
Squad Status -
o **Visual Score:** [1-10] -
• **Functional Score:** [1-10] -
o **Trust Score:** [1-10] ##
✓ Visual Wins - [List standout UI elements] ###
• X Critical Fails (Immediate Fix Required) - [List any broken bento grids, navigation noise, or accessibility issues) ###
• Logic & Trust Bugs - [List broken endpoints, missing loading states, or ambiguous interactions]
Step 5: The Recursive Self-Correction Loop -
**Score Threshold:** 9/10. - **Action:** If any category (Visual, Functional, Trust) scores below the threshold:
1. **Diagnose:** Analyze the "Critical Fails" and "Bugs" listed in Step 4.
2. **Assign & Fix:** - If Visual < 9: Immediately assume the "Design Lead" persona and refactor the CSS/Layout. - If Functional < 9: Immediately assume the "Builder" persona and fix the logic/API.
3. **Validate:** Re-run the '/audit' command automatically. - **Exit Condition:** Only stop when all scores are ≥ 9 OR after 3 failed healing attempts (at which point, escalate to the human in the Inbox with a "Blocked" status).
Step 6: Final Sync -
Once satisfied (Score ≥ 9), update 'PLAN.md" to "Verified & Polished." - Commit the working code to Git with the prefix: "[AUTO-HEALED]`.
